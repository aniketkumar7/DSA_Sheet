# DBMS Important Interview Questions

# Basic DBMS Concepts
1. What is DBMS? What are its advantages?
    A Database Management System (DBMS) is software that interacts with end-users, applications, and the database itself to capture and analyze data. The DBMS software additionally encompasses the core facilities provided to administer the database. The advantages of DBMS include:
    - Data Abstraction and Independence
    - Efficient Data Access
    - Data Integrity and Security
    - Data Administration
    - Concurrent Access and Crash Recovery
    - Reduced Application Development Time

2. What is the difference between DBMS and File System?
    - DBMS provides a systematic and organized way of storing, managing, and retrieving data, whereas a File System stores data in a collection of files.
    - DBMS supports multi-user environments and provides data consistency, integrity, and security, whereas File Systems are more prone to data redundancy and inconsistency.
    - DBMS offers advanced functionalities like transaction management, concurrency control, and backup and recovery, which are not available in traditional File Systems.

3. What are the different types of DBMS?
    - Hierarchical DBMS: Data is organized in a tree-like structure.
    - Network DBMS: Data is organized in a graph, allowing many-to-many relationships.
    - Relational DBMS (RDBMS): Data is organized in tables (relations) and supports SQL.
    - Object-oriented DBMS: Data is stored in objects, similar to object-oriented programming.
    - NoSQL DBMS: Designed for large-scale data storage and for massively-parallel, high-performance data processing across a large number of commodity servers.

4. Explain the 3-tier architecture of DBMS.
    - Presentation Tier: This is the user interface layer where users interact with the system. It includes the web browser, mobile app, or GUI.
    - Application Tier: Also known as the logic tier, it contains the application logic, business rules, and data processing logic. It acts as a mediator between the presentation tier and the data tier.
    - Data Tier: This layer consists of the database servers where data is stored and managed. It provides data access and storage services.

5. What is schema? Explain different types of schema.
    - A schema is a logical structure that defines the organization of data in a database. It describes how data is stored, the relationships between different data entities, and the constraints on the data.
    - Physical Schema: Defines how data is physically stored on storage devices.
    - Logical Schema: Defines the logical structure of the database, including tables, views, and relationships.
    - View Schema: Defines the user views of the data, which are subsets of the logical schema tailored for specific user needs.
